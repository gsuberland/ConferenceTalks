## Abstract

Transport layer security, otherwise known as TLS or SSL, has 
historically been a tricky protocol to properly manage and secure. Most 
organisations will have, at some point in time, received a pentest 
report containing a litany of issues regarding protocol version support,
insecure cipher suites, missing security extensions, deprecated hash 
functions, and so forth. These issues can be difficult to navigate due 
to the naturally terse nature of cryptography, the depth of historical 
reasoning that went into the TLS protocol design, and the diverse nature
of implementations. It should come as a relief, then, that TLS 1.3 
brings with it a new design mindset where (comparative) simplicity is 
seen as one of the cornerstones of secure protocol design. This talk 
discusses the changes and new features introduced with TLS 1.3, how 
these changes benefit both users and administrators, and some of at the 
challenges faced by those who wish to adopt this new protocol version.
