## Abstract

With the advent of IoT connected everything - doorbells, dishwashers, 
ovens, alarms, and uh... more private items - you may be interested to 
try your hand at pwning some devices. Messing with web portals and 
network traffic is one thing, but what about the board itself? What do 
those components do? What is that chip doing? How do I not electrocute 
myself? All equally important questions. This talk covers the basic 
hardware knowledge you need to start picking apart boards, accessing 
debug functionality, dumping firmware, and finding juicy secrets.
