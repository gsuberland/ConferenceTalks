## Abstract

Object Oriented Programming has been a staple part of programming for decades. From C++ to PHP, classes and objects have become a core part of the modern development paradigm. As systems have become more distributed, and as the requirement for low-complexity permanence of data has increased, serialisation has proven to be an extremely useful practice for the storage and transmission of data. However, as with all language constructs and features, there are pitfalls – many of which are practically unknown to the development community. This talk aims to explain and discuss the most common security issues relating to serialisation and deserialisation of objects in a range of modern languages, including PHP and C#. We will look at the language implementations, some common vulnerable development patterns, and some real-world examples of exploits. By the time we’re done, you’ll be all set for finding all sorts of fun bugs.
